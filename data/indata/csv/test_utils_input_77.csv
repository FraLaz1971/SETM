#lines starting with hash (#) are comments and are not part of the data table
#they can be skipped, data are organised in records (=lines/rows) and fields (column items)
#the following defaults will be respected
#field separator=,(comma), record separator=LF
#the last 4 rows contain metadata related to the table fields identifying each element of a column array
#and they are: row(-4)=field_name, row(-3)=physical_unit, 
#row(-2)=data_type (int|float|string),row(-1)=data_size in BYTES
#other 2 important metadata are retrieved directly from the file
#nfields=n. of fields in a row -columns of the tables- and nrows=n of rows/records in the file
#comments interleaving the data rows are simply neglected just as the comments before the rows -4,-1]
